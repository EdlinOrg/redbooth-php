Shameless self-plugging
-----------------------
I am a freelancing software developer (M.Sc.) that has been working fulltime for over 15 years now in various fields

See

for info on my background. Please feel free to contact me if you are looking for developers.
I prefer to work remotely on projects.

That said, let's carry on with some notes about this code:

redbooth-php
============

Basic php code to call the Redbooth (Teambox) api.

I needed to create tasks in Redbooth from Php, 
I don't have time/interest to flesh it out at the moment hence the code is very basic.

In my [teambox-bugtracker-bridge][teambox-bugtracker-bridge] code, in Python, you will see loads of other calls I make to the api, which you easily can adapt to be in php
